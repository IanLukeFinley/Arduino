This is a collection of NeoPixel code for my Zagreus cosplay.

Of particular interest is MegaTwoButtonClean.ino, which was used for the Stygian Blade, and may be of use for other LED designers.

The button position allows for a three way switch: an all-dark position, an all solid color position, and an animation position.

The animation includes a chase on the inside of the blade and a pulse on the outside, using the milis() function to keep them aligned.

Base code from tweaking4all.com and the always superlative Adafruit_Bill.
